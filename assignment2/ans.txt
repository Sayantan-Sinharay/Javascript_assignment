If we execute this Javascript, what will the browser's console show?

	var text = 'outside';

    function logIt(){
        console.log(text);
        var text = 'inside';
    };
logIt();


>>>> undifined bcz var text is reinitialised in the function scope and due to hoisting the content of the variable shows undifined.

Find the Output
 var x = 100;
    console.log(x);
     
    function test(){
        var x = 250;
        console.log(x);
     
        if (x > 100) {
            let x = 350;
            console.log(x);
        }
     
        console.log(x);
    }
     
    test();
    console.log(x);


>>>>>> 100, 250, 350, 250, 100 

What is the difference of output between these two expressions? Give your reasons for it:

12 == “12”  >>>>true, as the == indicates the value is only being compared
12 === “12” >>>> false, as the === indicates the value and the data type is also being compared
Number(12) === 12 >>>> undefined, as the Number(12) indicates object is being made



What is NaN?
>>>> Not a number, happens when number is required but rather a string is given.
